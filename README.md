# Batch Revoke Token Approvals

Are you feeling uneasy about the different dapps that you gave approval to spend ERC20 and REC721 tokens but can't revoke approvals for all of them due to high transaction cost?

The Batch Revoke Contract is a smart contract that allows you to revoke approvals for multiple tokens at once. It's a great way to save gas and avoid having to send multiple transactions to revoke approvals.
